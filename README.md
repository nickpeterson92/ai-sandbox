Consultagent is a working name, first of all. Second of all its a chatbot that is meant to do boring admin tasks through a chat interface.

Activate your new venv and run the below commmand to install dependencies:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

MAKE SURE YOU USE PIP3! If you use pip you will NOT resolve the necessary version of the trustcall library.
